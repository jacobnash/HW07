The program just uses the sleep function, because, I am lazy, I guess I could have used wait, but I didn't the reaping is done standardly. I also have code that over rides the signal, that i hsould put in it may or may not be in there depending on how lazy i am in. I'll comment it, it's actually good code. I dont know if that is the right CPID, but that is okay, because I still handle it.
